 <h2> Description: </h2>
 <p>It is the type of crustless cheesecake that is sold in Italian bakeries in New York. I usually make it with whole-milk ricotta which is creamier than low fat.</p>
  <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
  <ul>
   <li> 1 pound cream cheese, softened</li>
   <li>1 pound ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
    <li> 4 eggs </li>
    <li>¼ cup butter, melted and cooled</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups sour cream </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the middle of the oven.
     </li>
     <li>
      Beat the cream cheese, ricotta cheese, and sugar in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Beat in the eggs, one at a time. Add the butter, flour, cornstarch, and vanilla extract; mix until well combined. Fold in the sour cream and lemon juice. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 10-inch springform pan.  
      </li>
     <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake in the oven for 2 more hours. Remove from oven and let cool completely. Run a thin spatula around the edge of the cheesecake before springing open the pan to remove. Serve at room temperature or cold; refrigerate leftovers.
